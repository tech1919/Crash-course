# The FName Class

In Unreal Engine, `FName` is a class that is used to represent a name, which is a string identifier for a specific asset or object in the engine. `FName` is used throughout the engine to reference various resources and assets, such as levels, actors, materials, textures, animations, and more.

`FName` is a lightweight class that stores the name as an integer rather than a string, which makes it more efficient to use in various contexts. When you create a new `FName`, it gets added to a global name table, which is a lookup table that maps the integer value of the name to its corresponding string representation.

Here's an example of how you can create and use an `FName` in C++:

```cpp
// Create an FName object with a string name
FName MyName = FName("MyName");

// Create an FName object with a static string literal
FName MyOtherName = TEXT("MyOtherName");

// Get the string representation of an FName object
FString MyNameAsString = MyName.ToString();

// Compare two FName objects
if (MyName == MyOtherName)
{
    // Do something if the names are the same
}
else
{
    // Do something else if the names are different
}
```

In this example, we create two FName objects, one with a string name and another with a static string literal using the `TEXT()` macro. We then use the `ToString()` function of FName to get the string representation of an FName object. Finally, we compare the two FName objects using the `==` operator, which compares the integer values of the names.
