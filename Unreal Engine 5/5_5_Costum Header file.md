# Create Costum Header File

You can create new header file (`.h`) for including all the costum funciton or macro function definitions that you create.

By right clicking on the project name in the folder structue inside VisualStudio, and choose `create new item`. Then click on create new header file.

> * **Make sure that you create and save the new header file into the Source folder. The default folder that VisualStudio gives is the Intermidiate folder and that is a folder that regenerates every time the project is getting compiled, so it will delete every file that saved inside!**
